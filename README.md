# TestProject
SeleniumFramework
1. Download the project
2. Open the Project on Eclipse by following below steps:
	- Open Eclipse
	- Click on File menu and select "Open Projects from File System..." option
	- Select the project folder from the download location and click on "Open Folder" button
	- Right click the project on the Project explorer and install the dependencies using the maven commands
	- Right click on testng.xml file and select "Run as> TestNG suite" option
  
3.Test Scripts under src/test.java:
 test script 1 : ListOfCompanyAndProfiles.java
 test script 2 : filters.java
 
4.Things compromised because of time constraints:
 Have covered very basic functionality.
 Have used Thread.sleep because havent implemented fluent wait.
 Used Extent reports for reporting but havn't designed it.
 P.S---->> I wasted a ton of time in making a batch file to run testng.xml from cmd line but it didn't work.
